# Advent of Code ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about) repository! This is where I stash my solutions for the Advent of Code puzzles.

## What's in Here?

The repo is pretty simple:
Each year has it's own folder, and inside that, each day gets its own subfolder (if I complete that day...)
Here's what it looks like:

```
AdventOfCode/
â”œâ”€â”€ YYYY/             # Year (e.g., 2023, 2024, ...)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Day01/        # Day 1's solution
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Day02/        # Day 2's solution
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...           # More daily puzzles
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Day25/        # Day 25's solution
â””â”€â”€ README.md         # You're here!
```

## How It Works

**Programming Language:** The programming language and file formats may vary from year to year. Expect solutions in different file extensions and styles depending on what I decided to use that year.

**Input Files:** Each day's folder contains an input.txt file, which holds my personalized input for that day's challenge.
